### Purpose
The purpose of my repo is to demonstrate the benefit of running an application recording multiple employee salaries, 
while adding up those salaries to visually display monthly cost. I hope you find this helpful.

In order to this, I will be using JavaScript and jQuery.

### Outline

This application will provide input fields to collect employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary
