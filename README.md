# jQuery Salary Calculator

### Purpose
The purpose of my repo is to demonstrate the benefit of running an application to record multiple employee salaries, 
adding those salaries together, and displaying total monthly employee cost on screen. I will also add a 'Clear' button for you to delete the top entry in the table. You could use this application to justify adding more employees, down size, or keep as is.

In order to perform this application, I will be using JavaScript and jQuery.

### General Outline

My application will provide input fields to store employees first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. Once all fields have been filled out, a 'Submit' button will collect the information, use the information to calculate monthly cost, output that information before you on the screen, while resetting the input fields. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the total monthly cost will turn red.

I hope you find this helpful.
