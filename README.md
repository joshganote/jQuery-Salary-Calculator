# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description
Duration: 3 days

I will be creating an application to record employee salaries to report the total monthly cost. There will be input fields to take in values for first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. A submit button will collect all the information, append it to the DOM, and clear out the input fields. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000 the font color for the monthly salary cost with turn red. A clear button will allow the user to delete employees who push the cost over $20,000 to bring the font color out of red and back to black. 

## Setup

1. Open text editor of choice and create an index.html, client.js file, and style.css file.
2. Download the compressed 3.4.1 jQuery file from https://jquery.com/download/
3. Add script tags for jquery and your client.js file in the <head> section of your index.html file.
4. Link your style.css into the <head> section the index.html file.

## Usage

1. Right click on the index.html file and select "reveal in finder".
2. Once page is loaded you can begin added values into the input fields. 
3. Press submit and those values will show on the DOM under the input form. 
4. Keep adding as many employees as you like until the total monthly cost is above $20,000
5. Keep adding and delete employees to discover your monthly payroll.
